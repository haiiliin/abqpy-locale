msgid "A specific type of boundary condition object and a specific type of boundary condition state object are designed for each type of boundary condition. A BoundaryCondition object stores the non-propagating data of a boundary condition as well as a number of instances of the corresponding BoundaryConditionState object, each of which stores the propagating data of the boundary condition in a single step. Instances of the BoundaryConditionState object are created and deleted internally by its corresponding BoundaryCondition object."
