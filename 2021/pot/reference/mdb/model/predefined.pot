The PredefinedFieldState object stores the propagating data of the predefined field in a single step. A specific type of PredefinedField object and a specific type of PredefinedFieldState object are designed for each type of predefined field. Instances of the PredefinedFieldState object are created and deleted internally by its corresponding PredefinedField object."
